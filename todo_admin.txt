Based on the current architecture of Arthavi (a Fintech Portfolio Tracker + AI Chat), here is a breakdown of the critical missing features in your Admin Dashboard.

I have categorized these by Operational Priority (User Support, Data Integrity, System Health).

1. User Support & Operations (CRM)
Current State: You can view users, but cannot interact with them.

User Actions:
Ban/Suspend User: Critical for security or stopping abusive API usage.
Force Password Reset: Essential for handling "I forgot my password" support tickets.
Delete Account: Requirement for data privacy compliance (GDPR/DPDP).
Communications:
Notification System: Ability to send a system alert (e.g., "Maintenance at 2 AM" or "Your CAS import failed") to a specific user or all users.
Debug Mode:
Impersonation: "View as User" feature. Allows the admin to see exactly what the user sees to debug UI issues.
2. Data Integrity & Portfolio Ops
Current State: Read-only views of portfolios. No control over the engine.

CAS/File Parser Logs:
This is the #1 pain point in fintech. You need a dedicated view to see failed imports. Why did User X's PDF fail? (Password wrong? Unknown format?).
Master Data Management:
Stock/MF Correction: If a stock price is incorrect or multiple schemes are duplicated, an admin should be able to manually edit or merge entries in the 
StockMaster
 or 
Scheme
 tables.
Price Refresh Monitor:
A dashboard showing the status of your CRON jobs. Did the daily Nifty 50 price update run? If it failed, you need a "Retry Now" button.
3. AI Copilot Management
Current State: View chat history.

Feedback Loop:
Ability to Rate/Flag AI responses. If the AI gives bad financial advice, you need to mark it so you can tune the model later.
System Prompt Config:
Instead of hardcoding the prompt in Python, add a settings field to update the System Prompt dynamically (e.g., "Be more conservative" vs "Be more aggressive").
4. Admin Security & Roles
Current State: Single "Admin" role.

Audit Logs:
"Who deleted User X?" You need a log of every action taken by an admin for security audits.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Super Admin: Can create/delete admins.
Support Agent: Can view users but cannot see sensitive PII (PAN/Phone) or delete data.
5. Advanced Analytics (Business Intel)
Current State: Basic counters (Users, AUM).

User Retention (Cohort Analysis):
How many users who signed up last month are still active today?
Demographics:
Breakdown of users by Portfolio Size (e.g., Minnows vs Whales) or Asset Allocation (Equity heavy vs MF heavy).
Top Held Assets:
"What is the most popular stock among Arthavi users?" (e.g., 40% hold Reliance). Great for marketing checks.
Recommended Roadmap (Next Steps)
If I were prioritizing, I would build them in this order:

Server Logs / Parser Debugger (Critical for stability).
User Ban/Delete Actions (Critical for control).
Global Notification System (Critical for communication).
RBAC / Audit Logs (Security).
